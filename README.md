# GORM
GNSS Operations, Register and Monitoring system

Theese scripts are used for receiving, process and distribute RINEXv3
data files received from Permanent GNSS Stations.
Developed on CentOS 7, but should run RHEL 7 and 8. RHEL 8 is not quite supported yet due to
lack of support for BNC on RHEL 8.

Currently support Leica, Trimble and Septentrio data.
